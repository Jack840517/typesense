We are a small bootstrapped team that's trying to do big things with Typesense, so we'd be delighted to take all the help we can get.

Here are a couple of things we're looking for help with:

## ⚙️ Client libraries in additional languages

There are quite a few programming languages out there and we're not experts in all of them. So we'd appreciate your help in contributing towards a client library in a programming language that's your area of expertise. Please join our Slack Community to collaborate on the architecture. 

## 🚉 Integrations with platforms you use

If you use a particular Content Management Framework/System or E-Commerce Framework/Platform, an integration that pushes data from that platform/framework into Typesense would be a great value add for others in the community. 

## 🐛 Feature Requests & Bug Reports

If you find a bug or a missing feature that you'd find useful, please open an issue on Github. 

## 📖 Tutorials

Share your experience with the community about how you integrated with Typesense by writing an article about it. Or write a How-To or Tutorial on how to use Typesense for specific use cases and let us know. We'd love to share your work with the rest of the community by including it in our docs.

## 🏆 Showcases

Want to show-off your work that uses Typesense? We're building a Showcase to collect interesting use-cases for Typesense. Edit [this file](https://github.com/typesense/typesense/blob/master/SHOWCASE.md) and send us a PR.

## 🌟 Spread the Word

We are on a mission to democratize search by building an easy-to-use, yet powerful search engine for everyone. If you know friends, teams or communities that might find Typesense useful, let them know! Also, we wouldn't complain if you starred our Github repo :)
